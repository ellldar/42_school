# 42 School Piscine Files

## Hello dear Pisciner!
This is an ongoing project. So far I have just dumped all my piscine files as they are.
I will be updating this project during my free time.

I have collected most of the PDF documents, so you can read them and prepare as to what to expect during your time here.

## Getting started
There are three sections to this repository
* **Docs**  - This section contains most of the PDF files for days, rushes `(group projects)` and individual projects
* **Exams** - This section is organized so that for each exam you would have all the questions in a separate folder. Each folder will have the subject, the trace (the log) and the source code `C file`
* **main**  - This was my working folder where I kept all my source code
