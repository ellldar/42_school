## EXAM 01 Questions

On my second exam, I reached to Level 4. These are the questions I got during the exam.

### How did I do?

```
  Level 4:
    1: fprime for 11 potential points       ( Didn't do this one but you can the idea of what
                                            to expect at this level)
    0: ft_itoa for 16 potential points      (Failure - but included the solution as per Libft)
    0: tab_mult for 16 potential points     (Success)

    0: only_z for 16 potential points       (Success)
```
